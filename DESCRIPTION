Title: Farrow&Ball color palettes for all your ggplot needs
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alex Styer
Maintainer: Alex Styer <alex.styer@berkeley.edu>
Description: Enables easy creation of Farrow&Ball-inspired color palettes compatible with ggplot2. Includes 20 palettes that are designed to be useful for discrete scales that require many colors as well as continuous/divergent scales.
  Usage is familiar ggplot syntax scale_fill_fb() or scale_color_fb(). Both fill and color automatically ramp to match the number of colors required; can also be set as discrete/continuous with the argument discrete = TRUE/FALSE respectively.
